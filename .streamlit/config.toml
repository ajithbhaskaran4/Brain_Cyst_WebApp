# By default, Streamlit checks if the Python watchdog module is available
# and, if not, prints a warning asking for you to install it. The watchdog
# module is not required, but highly recommended. It improves Streamlit's
# ability to detect changes to files in your filesystem.

# If you'd like to turn off this warning, set this to True.

# Default: false
# disableWatchdogWarning = false

# By default, Streamlit displays a warning when a user sets both a widget
# default value in the function defining the widget and a widget value via
# the widget's key in `st.session_state`.

# If you'd like to turn off this warning, set this to True.

# Default: false
# disableWidgetStateDuplicationWarning = false

# If True, will show a warning when you run a Streamlit-enabled script
# via "python my_script.py".

# Default: true
# showWarningOnDirectExecution = true

# DataFrame serialization.

# Acceptable values:
# - 'legacy': Serialize DataFrames using Streamlit's custom format. Slow
# but battle-tested.
# - 'arrow': Serialize DataFrames using Apache Arrow. Much faster and versatile.

# Default: "arrow"
# dataFrameSerialization = "arrow"
